You can run the code by running main.py and then run the program generate_plots.py. For checking the plots access the plots folder. main.py creates a json file which will contain the data of BER and SNR which will be used to plot doppler changes, constellations and BER Vs SNR plot.

You can see the json file which contains the data of BER and SNR in the results folder 

generate_plots.py will produce the plots in the plots folder.
